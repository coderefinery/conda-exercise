# Conda exercise: get an old code to run

Here is an example code which used to work with
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) 1.14 - 1.15 and
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) 0.23 - 0.25.

It used to be run like this:
```
$ python example.py
```

**Your goal**: Make the code run without errors but without modifying `example.py`. Instead,
try to create a matching conda environment.

You can find a solution on the [solution](https://github.com/coderefinery/conda-exercise/tree/solution) branch.
